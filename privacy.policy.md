  <p><strong>ForgetMeNot: Wallet</strong><br>
  Last updated: 13 January 2026</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Our Commitment</h2>

  <p>
    ForgetMeNot is designed with your privacy as a core principle. The app helps you keep track
    of gift cards, store credits, perks, and rewards without requiring an account or sending your
    wallet contents to our servers.
  </p>

  <p><strong>The short version:</strong> We do not collect or store your wallet data on our servers.
  The information you enter into ForgetMeNot is stored locally on your device.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <p>
    The current version of ForgetMeNot does not collect any personally identifiable information
    (such as your name, email address, or physical address) and does not transmit your wallet
    contents (gift card details, notes, attachments, or credit balances) to our servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not use third-party analytics SDKs, advertising SDKs, or tracking libraries inside
    the app.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Information You Store in the App</h2>

  <p>
    ForgetMeNot allows you to store information such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Gift cards and store credits</li>
    <li>Return credits and vouchers</li>
    <li>Loyalty points or value balances</li>
    <li>Credit card perks and their recurring cycles</li>
    <li>Optional notes about how and where you received a credit</li>
    <li>Optional attachments (photos or screenshots)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This information is stored locally on your device using the app’s private storage.
    We do not have access to this data and do not sync it to our own servers.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Attachments (Photos and Screenshots)</h2>

  <p>
    You can optionally attach photos or screenshots (for example, a picture of a gift card or
    a receipt) to a credit. These images are stored locally on your device within the app’s
    sandboxed storage and are referenced by the app using a file URL.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not upload these attachments to our servers, and we do not use them for analytics,
    training, or advertising.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Local Notifications</h2>

  <p>
    ForgetMeNot uses <strong>local notifications</strong> to remind you about upcoming expirations
    and, for certain credit card perks, when a new perk period becomes active.
  </p>

  <p>
    These notifications are scheduled on your device and based on the data you enter
    (such as expiration dates and perk cycles). The scheduling information is stored locally;
    it is not sent to our servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can control notification permissions at any time in your device settings. If you revoke
    notification permissions, the app will stop showing reminders.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Camera and Photo Library Access</h2>

  <p>
    ForgetMeNot may request access to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera</strong> – to let you take a photo of a card, receipt, or other proof of value.</li>
    <li><strong>Photo Library</strong> – to let you attach existing screenshots or photos from your library.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These permissions are only used to allow you to select or capture an image to attach to a
    credit inside the app. The selected or captured image is stored locally as part of your
    wallet data. We do not upload these images to our servers.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>

  <p>
    Within the app, your data is used solely to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Display your credits, gift cards, and perks in the wallet interface.</li>
    <li>Calculate values such as active total, expiring soon, and used credits.</li>
    <li>Determine when to schedule local reminders (for expirations and certain perks).</li>
    <li>Show your attachments (photos and screenshots) alongside the relevant credit.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We do not use your data for profiling, advertising, behavioral tracking, or cross-site tracking.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Network Connections and Third-Party Services</h2>

  <p>
    ForgetMeNot does not send your wallet contents (gift card numbers, notes, attachments, or
    credit balances) to our servers or to third-party analytics providers.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, the app relies on platform services to function, for example:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Apple or Google app stores to download and update the app.</li>
    <li>Operating system services that deliver local notifications.</li>
    <li>External links that you choose to open (such as this privacy policy on GitHub).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These platform providers may collect their own technical or diagnostic information in
    accordance with their own privacy policies. We do not control, receive, or store that data
    as part of ForgetMeNot.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

  <p>
    ForgetMeNot is not designed for children under 13 and does not target children. The app
    does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Because wallet data stays
    on the device and is not transmitted to our servers, we do not have access to any
    information about how the app is used on individual devices.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

  <p>
    All wallet data is stored locally on your device. We do not maintain a server copy, so:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you delete a credit or attachment in the app, it is removed from your device storage.</li>
    <li>If you uninstall the app, the operating system deletes the app’s local data and we
        cannot recover it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Because we do not store your wallet contents on our servers, we cannot restore or retrieve
    your data if it is lost or deleted from your device.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Future Features</h2>

  <p>
    Future versions of ForgetMeNot may introduce optional features such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>On-device OCR to help read card numbers from photos.</li>
    <li>Optional multi-device sync or account-based features.</li>
    <li>Optional integrations (for example, email scanning) to automatically detect credits.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If we add features that transmit or process data beyond your device, they will be clearly
    described, strictly opt-in, and this Privacy Policy will be updated to explain exactly
    what changes and how your data is handled.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect new features, changes in
    the app, or legal requirements. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date
    at the top of this page. The latest version will always be available via the privacy
    policy link in the app’s Settings screen.
  </p>
