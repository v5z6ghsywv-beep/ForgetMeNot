ForgetMeNot – Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 09January2026
ForgetMeNot (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is built with privacy as a core principle.
This Privacy Policy explains how ForgetMeNot handles your data.
1. Overview
ForgetMeNot is an offline, on-device app for tracking gift cards, store credits, rewards points, vouchers, and reminders.
We designed the app so that your data stays entirely under your control.
2. No Data Leaves Your Device
ForgetMeNot stores all information locally on your device.
We do not collect, transmit, store, or process any user data on external servers.
This includes (but is not limited to):
Gift card details
Store credits
Points and rewards balances
Voucher information
Expiration dates
Notes or descriptions
Photos or attachments you choose to add
Notification schedules
Usage data
All data remains on the device and is never uploaded, synced, or shared.
3. No Accounts, No Personal Information
ForgetMeNot does not require account creation, sign-up, login, or the submission of any personal information.
The app does not collect or store:
Names
Emails
Phone numbers
Contacts
Location data
Device identifiers
You can use the entire app without providing any personal data.
4. No Tracking or Analytics
ForgetMeNot does not use:
Analytics tools
Tracking technologies
Crash reporting services
Advertising networks
Third-party SDKs
We do not monitor app usage or collect behavioral data.
5. Device Permissions
ForgetMeNot may request certain permissions to support optional features:
Local Notifications
Used only to alert you about upcoming expiration dates.
Notification data never leaves your device.
Photo Access (Optional)
If you add pictures to your credits, the app uses your device’s photo library.
Images are stored locally and never transmitted externally.
All permissions are optional and only used to perform the features you explicitly enable.
6. Data Deletion
Because all data is stored locally:
Deleting the app permanently removes all stored data.
You may also delete individual items within the app at any time.
We have no ability to access, recover, or restore deleted data.
7. Future Features
Future versions of ForgetMeNot may introduce optional features such as:
Cloud backup
Premium accounts
Multi-device sync
Email scanning (with explicit consent)
If such features are added, this Privacy Policy will be updated to clearly describe how data is handled and what remains on-device.
You will always have the option to use the app without enabling any cloud features.
8. Policy Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Any changes will be reflected in this document with a new effective date.
