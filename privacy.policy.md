<h1>ForgetMeNot – Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 09 January 2026</p>

<p><em>ForgetMeNot (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is built with privacy as a core principle. This Privacy Policy explains how ForgetMeNot handles your data.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>ForgetMeNot is an offline, on-device app for tracking gift cards, store credits, rewards points, vouchers, and reminders. We designed the app so that your data stays entirely under your control.</p>

<h2>2. No Data Leaves Your Device</h2>
<p>ForgetMeNot stores all information locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, store, or process any user data on external servers.</p>

<p>This includes (but is not limited to):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gift card details</li>
  <li>Store credits</li>
  <li>Points and rewards balances</li>
  <li>Voucher information</li>
  <li>Expiration dates</li>
  <li>Notes or descriptions</li>
  <li>Photos or attachments you choose to add</li>
  <li>Notification schedules</li>
  <li>Usage data</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>All data remains on the device and is never uploaded, synced, or shared.</strong></p>

<h2>3. No Accounts, No Personal Information</h2>
<p>ForgetMeNot does not require account creation, sign-up, login, or the submission of any personal information.</p>

<p>The app does not collect or store:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Names</li>
  <li>Emails</li>
  <li>Phone numbers</li>
  <li>Contacts</li>
  <li>Location data</li>
  <li>Device identifiers</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the entire app without providing any personal data.</p>

<h2>4. No Tracking or Analytics</h2>
<p>ForgetMeNot does <strong>not</strong> use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analytics tools</li>
  <li>Tracking technologies</li>
  <li>Crash reporting services</li>
  <li>Advertising networks</li>
  <li>Third-party SDKs</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not monitor app usage or collect behavioral data.</p>

<h2>5. Device Permissions</h2>
<p>ForgetMeNot may request certain permissions to support optional features:</p>

<h3>Local Notifications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Used only to alert you about upcoming expiration dates.</li>
  <li>Notification data never leaves your device.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Photo Access (Optional)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you choose to add pictures, the app accesses your device’s photo library.</li>
  <li>Images are stored locally and never transmitted externally.</li>
</ul>

<p>All permissions are optional and only used for the features you explicitly enable.</p>

<h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>
<p>Because all data is stored locally:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deleting the app permanently removes all stored data.</li>
  <li>You may delete individual items within the app at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have no ability to access, recover, or restore deleted data.</p>

<h2>7. Future Features</h2>
<p>Future versions of ForgetMeNot may introduce optional features such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cloud backup</li>
  <li>Premium accounts</li>
  <li>Multi-device sync</li>
  <li>Email scanning (with explicit consent)</li>
</ul>

<p>If such features are added, this Privacy Policy will be updated to clearly describe how data is handled and what remains on-device.</p>
<p>You will always have the option to use the app without enabling any cloud features.</p>

<h2>8. Policy Updates</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document with a new effective date.</p>
